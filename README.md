// WHAT I HAVE DONE

I have created multiple componest and routes (home page, Not found Story and show stories page) called them from the AppRouter via BrowserRouter.
onclick of the top Stories from the Nav Link, this will call the data fetcher which gets and sets the stories. 
This is done by making a API request to the URL using the given Base API URL, gets the data and maps it into the landing page.
each story returns the ID, By, title, kids, time and url. 

// EXTRA FEATURES
I added extra NavLink - Latest stories and Best Stories
I have addes the number of comments per story.
I used multiple componest to pass the data across (MVC)
I used tailwind for the CSS styling
